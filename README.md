## 🧠 Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing pressure-related time-series or sensor datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visual inspection of variable correlations, trends, and anomalies.
- **Modeling**: Implements algorithms such as `scikit-learn` models and `XGBoost` to capture relationships in the data.
- **Evaluation**: Compares models using performance metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE) to assess prediction accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
